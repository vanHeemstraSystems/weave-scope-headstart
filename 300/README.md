# 300 - Install Weave Scope

As discussed in the earlier section,Weave Scope consists of three parts: (1) probe, (2) app and (3) user interface. Scope can be deployed in either a standalone configuration or you can use Weave Cloud, in which case only the probes run in your environment, and the app and user interface are hosted by Weave Cloud.

Weave Scope can use Kubernetes, but it can be deployed to Docker environment as well.
